# DisasterDataIndonesia

This repo contains a method on parsing the Indonesian disaster record, stored in disinventar website.
There is a catch here, since the web is powered by javascript and not follow a simple html when moving around pages, one has to utilise Selenium to literally click the button.
For a simple html pages parsing, you can see alifsuss/PegadaianAddress repo, where I only use for loop to capture all address table in the website.
